**Contents of this repository:**

languages:
- *XArduino-ALE*: the complete definition of an executable Arduino DSL. The operational semantics are implemented using ALE metaprogramming approach.
- *XArduino-K3*: the complete definition of an executable Arduino DSL. The operational semantics are implemented using Kermeta metaprogramming approach.
- *XBPMN-ALE*: a representative of [Microflow DSL](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/microflows). The operational semantics are implemented using ALE metaprogramming approach.
- *XFSM-ALE*: the complete definition of an executable FSM DSL. The operational semantics are implemented using ALE metaprogramming approach.
- *XFSM-K3*: the complete definition of an executable FSM DSL. The operational semantics are implemented using Kermeta metaprogramming approach.
